# @necodex/markdown

Markdown Component based on Draft.js

## Installation

- Because Draft.js supports unicode, you must have the following meta tag in the `<head></head>`block of your HTML file:

```html
<meta charset="utf-8" />
```

## TODO:

- Add instructions for publishing (rollup and npm)
- Add how to use
- Add components documentation
- Add how to develop using storybook
- Add some info on peerDependencies like Draft.js and more
